Question: Use the func.py file. Create a function named 'majority_vote' that returns the majority vote from a list that is passed to your function. A majority vote is an element that occurs > N/2 times in a list (where N is the length of the list). Conditions:
The frequency of the majority element must be strictly greater than 1/2.
If there is no majority element, return None.
If the list is empty, return None.
Examples:
majority_vote(["A", "A", "A", "B", "C", "A"]) ➞ "A"
majority_vote(["A", "B", "B", "A", "C", "C"]) ➞ None

Question: Use the class.py file to test your solution. In the class script there are 3 imports (json, Bank, Client).
 The Client class is defined and documented in the source_code/client.py module. This class is responsible for describing a bank client (see its methods and object attributes). When we instantiate the objects of this class we use the data from location data/clients.json (a list of dictionaries where each dictionary is data for a single client).
 The Bank class is described in the source_code/Bank.py module. This class is called with the path to the data/clients.json file and is instantiating the client objects in a list and performing actions between the clients of a bank. 
 You will need to define the necessary methods in the Bank class according to the documentation written in these methods and add some methods of your own, if you deem it necessary, of course.
 Add a new method to the class Bank -> get_clients. This method receives no parameter and must be a generator function that yields at each iteretaion a Client object untill the list of clients is exausted.
